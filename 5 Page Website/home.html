            <p class="p-style">
                we strive to provide the best experience to our guests.
                Our coffees are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters,
                who made us who we are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives. 
                We opened our first cafe in 1996 at Brigade Road in Bangalore - the youth 
                and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, 
                and it continues to be one of the most happening places in the city.
                <br>
                At Asian Cafe we pride ourselves with the ability to offer our customers 
                delicious and authentic Asian food, 
                created at the highest standards. Every single meal we make is unique. 
                We guarantee that you won't get disappointed.
                <br>
                The key to our success is simple: providing exquisite meals,
                made out of only the purest and freshest of ingredients that taste great every single time.
                <br>
                Our goal is to help you enjoy the little things in life that matter. 
                So eat delicious food. Grab a drink. But most of all, relax! 
                We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your continued support.
